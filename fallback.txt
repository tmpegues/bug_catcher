Fallback plan

Pick up and sort unmoving bugs. This will essentially reuse assignment 3.2.
3.2 worked by sending the name of a planning scene object on the /pick service. We would then use
MoveIt services and actions to move to, pick up, and drop off the object.
To work with the turtles, we need to:
1. Change the pick service to have a BugInfo msg as its request instead of a string matching the
    name of a PlanningScene object. (Done, I believe)
    a. The 1st step of the callback will be taking the BugInfo and getting the pose out of it. (Done, I believe)
    b. The pick service maybe should also contain the pose of the base where the turtle is to be dropped. (Done, I believe)

2. Modify mpi functions:
    a. MoveAboveObject should now take a pose (Done)
    b. The Gripper functions might need to have a closing and opening distance set
    c. MoveToGoal should now take a pose (Done: what I did was actually change the call to MoveAboveObject and pass in the base pose)
    d. CloseGripper takes in a planning scene object. I think it will still be necessary to use a
        planning scene object, but I'll leave that to Nolan to create and attach the collision object.
    e. ReleaseObject: like CloseGripper, this requires a bit of planning scene stuff that I will leave to Nolan

3. The catch node will need to use this service.
4. The launch file will need to be re-setup with the right functions
