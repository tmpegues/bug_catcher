Fallback plan

Pick up and sort unmoving bugs. This will essentially reuse assignment 3.2.
3.2 worked by sending the name of a planning scene object on the /pick service. We would then use
MoveIt services and actions to move to, pick up, and drop off the object.
To work with the turtles, we need to:
1. Change the pick service to have a BugInfo msg as its request instead of a string matching the
    name of a PlanningScene object.
    a. The 1st step of the callback will be taking the BugInfo and getting the pose out of it.
    b. The pick service maybe should also contain the pose of the base where the turtle is to be dropped.

2. Modify mpi functions:
    a. MoveAboveObject should now take a pose
    b. The Gripper functions might need to have a closing and opening distance set
    c. MoteToGoal should now take a pose

3. The catch node will need to use this service.
4. The launch file will need to be re-setup with the right functions
